# Probility

Probility is a WIP progress library that aims to provide an easy-to-understand interface for creating probability distributions and generating data from those distributions.

Probility provides both a class to interface with data collections and a set of functions to generate practical 
tests of outcomes and theoretical enumerations of expected outcomes for complex probability rules. 

To see the current power of Probility, please check out the "Examples" folder and run the sample code in Node.

## Why Probility?

My game-designer coworker trying to work out various combinations of die rolls using an Excel table initially 
inspired this project. I hope that, as it works now, Probility provides an easy way to interface with, describe, and 
explore probabilistic collections of data. In the future, I hope to make it even more robust by allowing developers 
to store and manipulate different states of a single Probility instance.
